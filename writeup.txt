Publication request writeup for draft-ietf-capport-rfc7710bis-03

Intended status: Proposed Standard
Working group: capport
Document shepherd: Martin Thomson

Technical Summary:

This document defines DHCP and RA options that allow a network to indicate the
location of a captive portal.

This version of the document replaces RFC 7710 with clarifications about what
the "location of a captive portal" means, a means for a network to indicate the
absence of a captive portal, and a new DHCP code point that we believe to be
uncontested.

Working Group Summary:

This document was fairly uncontroversial in discussions.

Document Quality:

The document is a considerable refinement over the previous version, which left
many aspects undefined.  Experiments (and multiple implementations) revealed
that the previous version was undeployable due to the DHCP option conflict.  We
have several implementations and have validated this.  Those implementations are
prototype quality, but implemented in major operating system stacks, so we are
confident that this is implementable.

Personnel:

Martin Thomson is document shepherd.  Barry Leiba is the responsible Area Director.

Important information:

This document represents the consensus of the capport WG.  There were no
significant problems with this particular document.

It is the understanding of the shepherd that extensive collaboration was
undertaken by authors with IANA, DHC, and the DHCP registry experts in reaching
the conclusions in the draft.

IPR disclosures from authors have been checked.  No IPR disclosures have been
made with reference to this work.

IANA considerations were checked and cleaned up.  Entries are registered, but no
new registries created.

Validation is limited to nits check (which only has false positives).
