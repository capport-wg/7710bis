    <abstract>
      <t>In many environments offering short-term or temporary Internet access
      (such as coffee shops), it is common to start new connections in a
      captive portal mode. This highly restricts what the customer can do
      until the customer has authenticated.</t>

      <t>This document describes a DHCPv4 and DHCPv6 option and a Router Advertisement
      (RA) option to inform clients that they are behind some sort of
      captive-portal enforcement device, and that they will need to authenticate to get
      Internet access. It is not a full solution to address all of the issues
      that clients may have with captive portals; it is designed to be one
      component of a standardized approach for hosts to interact with such
      portals. While this document defines how the network operator may convey
      the captive portal API endpoint to hosts, the specific methods of
      authenticating to, and interacting with the captive portal are out of
      scope of this document.</t>

      <t>This document replaces RFC 7710.  RFC 7710 used DHCP code point 160.
      Due to a conflict, this document specifies 114.</t>

      <t>[ This document is being collaborated on in Github at:
      https://github.com/capport-wg/7710bis. The most
      recent version of the document, open issues, etc should all be available
      here. The authors (gratefully) accept pull requests. Text in square
      brackets will be removed before publication. ]</t>

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>In many environments, users need to connect to a captive-portal
      device and agree to an Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) and / or provide
      billing information before they can access the Internet. Regardless of
      how that mechanism operates, this document provides functionality
      to allow the client to know when it is
      behind a captive portal and how to contact it.</t>

      <t>In order to present users with the payment or AUP pages, presently a
      captive-portal enforcement device has to intercept the user's connections and
      redirect the user to a captive portal server, using methods that are very
      similar to man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks. As increasing focus is
      placed on security, and end nodes adopt a more secure stance, these
      interception techniques will become less effective and/or more
      intrusive.</t>

      <t>This document describes a DHCPv4 <xref target="RFC2131"/> and DHCPv6
      <xref target="RFC8415"/> option (Captive-Portal) and an IPv6
      Router Advertisement (RA) <xref target="RFC4861"/> option that informs
      clients that they are behind a captive-portal enforcement device and
      the API endpoint that the host can contact for more information.</t>

      <t>This document replaces RFC 7710 <xref target="RFC7710"/>.</t>

    <section anchor="option" title="The Captive-Portal Option">
      <t>The Captive Portal DHCP / RA Option informs the client that it may be
      behind a captive portal and provides the URI to access an API as defined
      by [draft-ietf-capport-api]. This is primarily intended to improve the
      user experience by showing the user the captive portal information faster and more
      reliably. Note that, for the foreseeable future, captive portals will
      still need to implement interception techniques to serve legacy
      clients, and clients will need to perform probing to detect captive
      portals.</t>

      <t>Clients that support the Captive Portal DHCP option SHOULD include the
      option in the Parameter Request List in DHCPREQUEST messages. DHCP servers
      MAY send the Captive Portal option without any explicit request.</t>

      <t>In order to support multiple "classes" of clients (e.g. IPv4 only,
      IPv6 only with DHCPv6 (<xref target="RFC8415"/>), and IPv6 only with RA) the
      captive network can provision the client with the URI via multiple methods (IPv4 DHCP, IPv6
      DHCP, and IPv6 RA). The captive portal operator SHOULD ensure that the URIs
      provisioned by each method are equivalent to reduce the chance of operational problems.
      The maximum length of the URI that can be carried in IPv4 DHCP is 255
      bytes, so URIs longer than 255 bytes should not be provisioned via IPv6 DHCP nor
      IPv6 RA options.</t>

      <t>In all variants of this option, the URI MUST be that of the captive
      portal API endpoint, conforming to the recommendations for such URIs
      [draft-ietf-capport-api].
      </t>

      <t>A captive portal MAY do content negotiation (<xref target="RFC7231"/>
      section 3.4) and attempt to redirect clients querying without an
      explicit indication of support for the captive portal API content type
      (i.e. without application/capport+json listed explicitly anywhere within
      an Accept header vis. <xref target="RFC7231"/> section 5.3). In so
      doing, the captive portal SHOULD redirect the client to the value
      associated with the "user-portal-url" API key. When performing such
      content negotiation (<xref target="RFC7231"/> Section 3.4), implementors
      of captive portals need to keep in mind that such responses might be
      cached, and therefore SHOULD include an appropriate Vary header field
      (<xref target="RFC7231"/> Section 7.1.4) or mark them explicitly
      uncacheable (for example, using
      Cache-Control: no-store <xref target="RFC7234"/> Section 5.2.2.3).
      </t>

      <t>The URI SHOULD NOT contain an IP address literal. Exceptions to this
      might include networks with only one operational IP address family where
      DNS is either not available or not fully functional until the captive
      portal has been satisfied.</t>

      <t>Networks with no captive portals MAY explicitly indicate this
      condition by using this option with the IANA-assigned URI for this
      purpose. Clients observing the URI value
      "urn:ietf:params:capport:unrestricted" MAY forego time-consuming forms of
      captive portal detection.</t>

    <section anchor="security" title="Security Considerations">
      <t>By removing or reducing the need for captive portals to perform MITM
      hijacking, this mechanism improves security by making the portal and its
      actions visible, rather than hidden, and reduces the likelihood that users
      will disable useful security safeguards like DNSSEC validation, VPNs, etc.
      In addition, because the system knows that it is behind a captive portal,
      it can know not to send cookies, credentials, etc.  By handing out a URI
      which is protected with TLS, the captive portal operator can attempt to
      reassure the user that the captive portal is not malicious.</t>

      <t>Each of the options described in this document is presented to a node
      using the same protocols used to provision other information critical
      to the node's successful configuration on a network.  The security
      considerations applicable to each of these provisioning mechanisms also
      apply when the node is attempting to learn the information conveyed in
      these options. In the absence of security measures like RA Guard
      (<xref target="RFC6105"/>, <xref target="RFC7113"/>) or DHCP Shield
      <xref target="RFC7610"/>, an attacker could inject, modify, or block DHCP
      messages or RAs.</t>

      <t>An attacker with the ability to inject DHCP messages or RAs
      could include an option from this document to force users to contact
      an address of his choosing. As an attacker with this capability could
      simply list themselves as the default gateway (and so intercept all the
      victim's traffic); this does not provide them with significantly more
      capabilities, but because this document removes the need for
      interception, the attacker may have an easier time performing the
      attack.</t>

      <t>However, as the operating systems and application that make use of this
      information know that they are connecting to a captive-portal device (as
      opposed to intercepted connections) they can render the page in a
      sandboxed environment and take other precautions, such as clearly
      labeling the page as untrusted. The means of sandboxing and user
      interface presenting this information is not covered in this document -
      by its nature it is implementation specific and best left to the
      application and user interface designers.</t>

      <t>Devices and systems that automatically connect to an open network
      could potentially be tracked using the techniques described in this
      document (forcing the user to continually authenticate, or exposing
      their browser fingerprint). However, similar tracking can already be
      performed with the presently common captive portal mechanisms, so this
      technique does not give the attackers more capabilities.</t>

      <t>Captive portals are increasingly hijacking TLS connections to force
      browsers to talk to the portal. Providing the portal's URI via a DHCP or
      RA option is a cleaner technique, and reduces user expectations of being
      hijacked - this may improve security by making users more reluctant to
      accept TLS hijacking, which can be performed from beyond the network
      associated with the captive portal.</t>

             title="Observations From IETF 106 Network Experiment">
      <t>During IETF 106 in Singapore an <eref
        target="https://tickets.meeting.ietf.org/wiki/IETF106network#Experiments"
          >experiment</eref> enabling Captive Portal API compatible clients to
        discover a venue-info-url (see <eref
        target="https://tickets.meeting.ietf.org/wiki/CAPPORT">
        experiment description</eref> for more detail) revealed that some
        Polycom devices on the same network made use of DHCPv4 option code 160
        for <eref
        target="https://community.polycom.com/t5/VoIP-SIP-Phones/DHCP-Standardization-160-vs-66/td-p/72577"
        >other purposes</eref>.</t>

      <t>The presence of DHCPv4 Option code 160 holding a value indicating the
      Captive Portal API URL caused these devices to not function as desired.
      For this reason, this document requests IANA deprecate option code 160 and
      reallocate different value to be used for the Captive Portal API URL.</t>
