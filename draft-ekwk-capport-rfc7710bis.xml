    <abstract>
      <t>In many environments offering short-term or temporary Internet access
      (such as coffee shops), it is common to start new connections in a
      captive portal mode. This highly restricts what the customer can do
      until the customer has authenticated.</t>

      <t>This document describes a DHCP option (and a Router Advertisement
      (RA) extension) to inform clients that they are behind some sort of
      captive-portal device, and that they will need to authenticate to get
      Internet access. It is not a full solution to address all of the issues
      that clients may have with captive portals; it is designed to be used in
      larger solutions. The method of authenticating to, and interacting with
      the captive portal is out of scope of this document.</t>

      <t> [ This document is being collaborated on in Github at:
      https://github.com/wkumari/draft-ekwk-capport-rfc7710bis. The most
      recent version of the document, open issues, etc should all be available

    <section title="Introduction">
      <t>In many environments, users need to connect to a captive-portal
      device and agree to an Acceptable Use Policy (AUP) and / or provide
      billing information before they can access the Internet. It is
      anticipated that the IETF will work on a more fully featured protocol at
      some point, to ease interaction with Captive Portals. Regardless of how
      that protocol operates, it is expected that this document will provide
      needed functionality because the client will need to know when it is
      behind a captive portal and how to contact it.</t>

      <t>In order to present users with the payment or AUP pages, the
      captive-portal device has to intercept the user's connections and
      redirect the user to the captive portal, using methods that are very
      similar to man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks. As increasing focus is
      placed on security, and end nodes adopt a more secure stance, these
      interception techniques will become less effective and/or more
      intrusive.</t>

      <t>This document describes a DHCP (<xref target="RFC2131"/>) option
      (Captive-Portal) and an IPv6 Router Advertisement (RA) (<xref
      target="RFC4861"/>) extension that informs clients that they are behind
      a captive-portal device and how to contact it.</t>

        <t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
        "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
        document are to be interpreted as described in <xref
        target="RFC2119"/>.</t>

    <section title="The Captive-Portal Option">
      <t>The Captive Portal DHCP / RA Option informs the client that it is
      behind a captive portal and provides the URI to access an authentication
      page. This is primarily intended to improve the user experience by
      getting them to the captive portal faster; for the foreseeable future,
      captive portals will still need to implement the interception techniques
      to serve legacy clients, and clients will need to perform probing to
      detect captive portals.</t>

      <t>In order to support multiple "classes" of clients (e.g. IPv4 only,
      IPv6 only with DHCPv6 (<xref target="RFC3315"/>), IPv6 only with RA) the
      captive portal can provide the URI via multiple methods (IPv4 DHCP, IPv6
      DHCP, IPv6 RA). The captive portal operator should ensure that the URIs
      handed out are equivalent to reduce the chance of operational problems.
      The maximum length of the URI that can be carried in IPv4 DHCP is 255
      bytes, so URIs longer than 255 bytes should not be used in IPv6 DHCP or
      IPv6 RA.</t>

      <t>In order to avoid having to perform DNS interception, the URI SHOULD
      contain an address literal. If the captive portal allows the client to
      perform DNS requests to resolve the name, it is then acceptable for the
      URI to contain a DNS name. The URI parameter is not null terminated.</t>

    <section anchor="security" title="Security Considerations">
      <t>An attacker with the ability to inject DHCP messages could include
      this option and so force users to contact an address of his choosing. As
      an attacker with this capability could simply list himself as the
      default gateway (and so intercept all the victim's traffic); this does
      not provide them with significantly more capabilities, but because this
      document removes the need for interception, the attacker may have an
      easier time performing the attack. As the operating systems and
      application that make use of this information know that they are
      connecting to a captive-portal device (as opposed to intercepted
      connections) they can render the page in a sandboxed environment and
      take other precautions, such as clearly labeling the page as untrusted.
      The means of sandboxing and user interface presenting this information
      is not covered in this document - by its nature it is implementation
      specific and best left to the application and user interface
      designers.</t>

      <t>Devices and systems that automatically connect to an open network
      could potentially be tracked using the techniques described in this
      document (forcing the user to continually authenticate, or exposing
      their browser fingerprint). However, similar tracking can already be
      performed with the standard captive portal mechanisms, so this technique
      does not give the attackers more capabilities.</t>

      <t>Captive portals are increasingly hijacking TLS connections to force
      browsers to talk to the portal. Providing the portal's URI via a DHCP or
      RA option is a cleaner technique, and reduces user expectations of being
      hijacked - this may improve security by making users more reluctant to
      accept TLS hijacking, which can be performed from beyond the network
      associated with the captive portal.</t>

      <t>By simplifying the interaction with the captive portal systems, and
      doing away with the need for interception, we think that users will be
      less likely to disable useful security safeguards like DNSSEC
      validation, VPNs, etc. In addition, because the system knows that it is
      behind a captive portal, it can know not to send cookies, credentials,
      etc. By handing out a URI using which is protected with TLS, the captive
      portal operator can attempt to reassure the user that the captive portal
      is not malicious.</t>
